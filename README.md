🚢 Ship-Port-Management System

🧠 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Ship Port Management System as a web-based application that enables efficient management and tracking of port operations. The system focuses on managing critical data related to ships, ports, cargo, and captains—streamlining operations and enhancing decision-making for port authorities and stakeholders.

⚙️ Implementation

The project was implemented using Flask and SQLite to manage back-end logic and data storage.

Key Functionalities:
- User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality.
- Ship Management: Add and manage ship data (name, type, capacity, etc.).
- Captain Management: Track and manage captain profiles.
- Port & Cargo Tracking: Manage port details and track cargo (description, weight, and associated port).
- Port Reservation System: Reserve ports for ships, specifying arrival and departure times.
- Reports and Dashboards: Generate useful reports about cargo, reservations, and port usage.

The user-friendly frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and Flask templates for seamless interaction and navigation.

✅ Achievements

- Successfully developed and deployed a ship port management system with core functionalities.
- Integrated user authentication for controlled access.
- Enabled ship reservation and management features.
- Provided a responsive, clean user interface for intuitive navigation and data entry.

🔮 Future Enhancements

- Notifications: Alert when port capacity nears full (constraint management).
- Advanced Analytics: More detailed reporting on port usage and performance over time.
- Multi-User Roles: Role-based access for admins, port managers, and logistics teams.
- Database Upgrade: Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production-level scalability.
